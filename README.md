<h1>Welcome to where it all started.</h1>

<p>This was my first project (on Landstede) in which I had to design and create a portfolio which I'd use for engagement.</p>
<p>Though outdated now I want to start a new and make it more enticing. The way I used the code makes me sick at this point but throughout the years I've wanted to change this and soon I will.</p>
<p>That means making the code prettier and the accessibility better. Also the way it looks should be made better to keep the viewers engaged.</p>
